<p>1. Responsive Design is used to create the web page creation. Which is used 
    of different types of layouts and images. In short it is a way to adjust the 
    screen type of many users screen. We can also, see the size difference between 
    iPad and MacBook. Responsive design contains a various type of different layouts 
    and images. These are all adjustable with html and css. The difference is, when a 
    user switches from one screen size to another the view of the entire website changes 
    according to the size of the screen that the user is using. In this research I discovered 
    that responsive design is something which should be considered while making the websites.
    It is very important for any website maker to be able to provide the users with the perfect 
    view of their website. Coding and designing according to that is very important for web designing.

    2.	Responsive design is related to web technologies. When we considered this term we know that
    with the display of any website it should also fulfill the purpose of the website. Things like 
    form validation is need for any website displaying form on its page. We know that a form needs 
    validation and for that we need to Create code to send the computer message of the requirements 
    that have to be done. Things that associate with this are the markup languages and multimedia packages. 
    This is known as web technology. Therefore, responsive design and web technologies go into hand in hand. 
    Without both of them we can never imagine a display of a running website. They both are considered advantages
    for building any website.
    <br>
    3. From my research I learned that building the web apps that they all have the feature for building 
    the websites considering the different screen amount. Also, each display Screenâ€™s size is different from 
    another. Although, we add the same features for each website, we know that it will give some difference when 
    it will come to considering for a different screen size. So, for that reason of that we have responsive design 
    and web technologies. Also, for building web apps we know that the screen size in regards to the display of things 
    in any website will matter. It can be an image for any type of layout which we design in our website.

    4. My learning experience in this course has been very great. I have learned a lot of new things. All of 
    them being very fun to learn and explore. I have made websites in past with WordPress, but making it with 
    the code knowledge was a very fun experience. Things like logo, Titles in html to styling the pages in css 
    and code validation in JavaScript was very fun to learn. I have enjoyed each and every assignment in this course
    with developing more website designing skills every time. I have learned many things which I can apply in my day 
    to day life as a web developer. Overall, I enjoyed a lot in this course and it was a very great experience.
